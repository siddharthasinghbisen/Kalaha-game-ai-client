Kalaha game application in Java where it explores the areas of Artificial Intelligence in two-player games with perfect information, and networking. In AI aspect, the computer player of the program whom a
user can choose to play against finds intelligent moves by using minimax algorithm with
alpha-beta pruning. In networking aspect, the game is able to play against another human
player via a network. Hence, theoretical parts that are applied in implementing the program
such as game trees, minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning and client-server model are
discussed. The design of the program is based on object-oriented programming and there
are classes that can be extended for implementing any two-player game. As the conclusion,
over all result of the implementation is satisfactory, since the program meets the
requirements that have been set.
